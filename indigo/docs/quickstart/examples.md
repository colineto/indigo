title: Examples
---

At various points in Indigo's development, little games and examples have been made. These help drive out requirements, test the feel of the engine against real examples and help ensure the build is stable.

They are not always very polished, but they are small and reasonably easy to follow.

> The examples have moved. They now track the latest public release!

They can all be found in the [indigo-examples](https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/indigo-examples) repo.

Please visit the [repo](https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/indigo-examples) for more information.

You can play a game of [Snake](/snake.html) and try the [The Cursed Pirate](/pirate.html) demo on this site. Please note that The Cursed Pirate is not a game, just a little demo of how you might build a platformer.
